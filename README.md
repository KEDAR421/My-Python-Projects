# My-Python-Projects
A collection of Python scripts for practicing Digital Signal Processing (DSP), symbolic math, and data analysis. Uses libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy, and SymPy.

#Python for Digital Signal Processing & Data Analysis
This repository is a collection of my Python scripts and assignments from my studies in Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and related numerical methods. It includes implementations of fundamental concepts, demonstrating the use of powerful scientific and data analysis libraries.

##Key Topics Covered
Signal Operations:

Addition and multiplication of discrete-time signals with different time axes.

Manual implementation of the convolution sum.

Frequency Analysis:

Using Discreate fourier transform (DFT),Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to analyze signal spectra.

Implementing digital filters by applying transfer functions in the frequency domain.

Signal Sampling:

Downsampling and upsampling signals using NumPy slicing and SciPy's resample function.

Numerical Methods & Linear Algebra:

Basic matrix creation, indexing, and arithmetic with NumPy.

A custom class for complex number arithmetic and a polynomial root-finding algorithm.

Technologies Used
Python 3

NumPy: For numerical operations and array/matrix manipulation.

Pandas: For data handling and analysis.

Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing signals and spectra.

SciPy: For advanced signal processing functions like FFT and resampling.

How to Use
Each .py file is a standalone script that can be run from the command line to see the output or generate plots. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
